# Deploying Smart Contracts

Getting your dApp live on Mix is simple:

* Replace the generic RPC address with a Mix-specific one for targeted deployment.

[Please see the RPC page for more details.](../../basics/getting-started-with-fuse/network-details.mdx)

* The network id must be updated.
* Switch the Default Network to Mix
