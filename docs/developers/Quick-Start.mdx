### Get Started with Mix

This guide will provide you with an overview of the Mix ecosystem. It will also include links to helpful resources and websites that will help you learn more about building blockchain applications, not only on Mix but also on other platforms.

### Building on Mix

If you are an Ethereum developer, you are already a Mix developer. Simply switch to the [Mix RPC](https://docs.miexs.com/docs/basics/getting-started-with-fuse/network-details) and get started. All the tools you are familiar with on the Ethereum blockchain are supported on Mix by default, such as Truffle, Remix, and Web3js.

You can deploy decentralized applications to either Mix Spark Testnet or the Mainnet.

### Publicly available Mix RPC endpoints

Check out a [list of public endpoints](https://docs.miexs.com/docs/basics/getting-started-with-fuse/rpc#fuse-labs) for the Mix Network.

### Subgaphs

You can easily get the indexed data from the blockchain through the different [subgraphs solutions](https://docs.miexs.com/docs/developers/subgraphs/) available on Mix Network.




### Oracles

Mix integrated with industry-leader [oracle providers](https://docs.miexs.com/docs/developers/oracles) Dia and Supra for maximum flexibility to access price feeds.

### Wallets

To interact with the Mix Network, you need to have an Ethereum-based wallet because Mix runs on Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). You can add Mix to [MetaMask](https://docs.miexs.com/docs/basics/getting-started-with-fuse/wallets/add-fuse-to-metamask-and-other-wallets), which allows you to connect to Mix using [RPC](https://docs.miexs.com/docs/basics/getting-started-with-fuse/wallets/add-fuse-to-metamask-and-other-wallets). For more endpoints

### Smart Contracts

Mix supports many services you can use to test, compile, debug, and deploy decentralized applications onto the Mix Network. These include deployment using [Hardhat](https://docs.miexs.com/docs/developers/deploying-smart-contracts/using-hardhat), [Thirdweb](https://docs.miexs.com/docs/developers/deploying-smart-contracts/using-thirdweb) and [Remix](https://docs.miexs.com/docs/developers/deploying-smart-contracts/using-remix-and-metamask).

Mix Token (MIX) is the native token on the Mix Network. Its official versions exist on the Ethereum, BSC, Polygon and Arbitrum networks. [Here](https://docs.miexs.com/docs/developers/important-smart-contracts/fuse-token-on-other-chains) you can find relevant smart contracts.




### Building a new dApp on Mix?

Decentralized applications (dApps) serve as the link between users and data privacy on the blockchain. The growing prevalence of dApps underscores their value in the blockchain environment, addressing issues such as facilitating transactions between two parties without a central authority through smart contracts. 

If you're new to creating decentralized applications (dApps), the resources mentioned below will provide you with a jumpstart on the necessary tools to construct, troubleshoot, and launch dApps on the Mix Network.

### Note

If you find all of this overwhelming, don't worry! You can jump right in and start experimenting. However, here are a few things to keep in mind before you dive into the available resources, repositories, and documentation:

1. Be aware of the challenges of being on the cutting edge: Like any specialized field of programming, dApps and blockchain development evolve rapidly. During your research, you may come across complex code repositories, documentation sites with broken links, or even a lack of documentation altogether. Take this as an opportunity to reach out to us through any social media channel for assistance.
2. The learning curve may seem intimidating, but the entry barrier is low: The community is incredibly open and welcoming! Projects actively encourage contributions from external developers and are committed to resolving any obstacles you may encounter. We are all working towards creating a better world, and any form of contribution is highly appreciated. We would be thrilled to have you join this incredible Web3 ecosystem.
