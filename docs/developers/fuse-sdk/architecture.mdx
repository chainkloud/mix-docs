  * Admin API for automating tasks like rewards and airdropping.
  * Notifications API for subscribing to updates about wallet activity.
  * Trade API for fetching trade data and assisting with swaps.
  * Payment Link API for creating payment links.
  * DATA APIs enable additional indexed data such as balances, transaction histories, and more.
* Indexers, including subgraphs and the explorer.
* Mix Network serves as the underlying infrastructure for the Mix Stack.
* Smart Wallet Contracts and their modules.
* Token contracts, including ERC20 tokens and ERC721 (NFTs).
