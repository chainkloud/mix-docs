# Oracles

Blockchain oracles are third-party services that provide data to smart contracts running on a blockchain network. Oracles act as intermediaries between the blockchain network and the outside world, enabling smart contracts to execute based on real-world events or data.

## SupraOracles

SupraOracles infrastructure allows developers to securely connect their Web3 apps with timely and accurate data from other blockchains or real-world sources.

Price feeds are available for MIX/USDT in the Fuse ecosystem, and almost 100 more token pair price feed contracts can be found [here](https://supraoracles.com/docs/price-feeds/decentralized/trading-pairs-decentralized/). Including popular pairs such as BTC/USDT, ETH/USDT, and BTC/USD. Use SupraOracle’s comprehensive [integration guide](https://supraoracles.com/docs/price-feeds/decentralized) to connect to the relevant smart contract. 

One more service that SupraOracles offers is VRF (Verifiable Random Function). VRFs enable the generation of pseudorandom numbers that can be cryptographically verified. They are commonly used in on-chain applications such as gaming, NFT minting, lotteries, and randomized processes. Supra’s VRF can provide the exact properties required for a random number generator (RNG) to be fair. With tamper-proof, unbiased, and cryptographically verifiable random numbers. Employed by smart contracts, opening the door to new and exciting dApps on Fuse. 

## DIA

DIA is a blockchain project that provides decentralized oracles for financial and economic data. DIA's oracles enable developers to build decentralized applications (dApps) that require real-time, high-quality financial data, without the need for a centralized data provider. Read more about DIA on their [website](https://www.diadata.org/) and [documentation](https://docs.diadata.org/).

Check the list of [price feeds](https://docs.diadata.org/documentation/oracle-documentation/deployed-contracts#fuse) available on the Mix Network.

## Chainlink

A centralized version on Chainlink data feeds will be launched soon.
