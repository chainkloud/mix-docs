# Obtaining Assets to Transact on Mix

Once a user has connected a wallet to the Mix Network blockchain, they may want to obtain Mix assets directly to be able to transact.

One asset that they will need is Mix Network's native token, [MIX](../intro-to-fuse/fuse-token.mdx). MIX on Mix Network can be obtained using fiat-to-crypto on-ramps or centralized exchanges. The on-ramps currently supporting MIX purchases include [TransFi](https://buy.transfi.com) and [Transak](https://transak.com).&#x20;

The exchanges where you can buy MIX on Mix are MEXC Global, AscendEx, and Bitazza Global.&#x20;

Both on-ramps and the aforementioned exchanges allow users to get funds from their bank accounts to have MIX in their blockchain wallet directly, with the on-ramps being the most straightforward option.

In addition, the aforementioned on-ramp providers and [Ramp Network](https://ramp.network/) also support the purchases of the reputable USD Circle (USDC) stablecoin on Mix Network.&#x20;

Alternatively, users wishing to move their funds to Mix Network from other chains without going through centralized intermediaries can obtain one of the assets that can be bridged to Mix Network from the chains to which it is connected through the [supporting cross-chain bridges](asset-bridges-to-other-chains.mdx).
